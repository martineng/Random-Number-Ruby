# Random-Number-Ruby
This program will automatically generate random number into array, doing sorting and searching in Ruby.

All of the elements in the array will be printed on screen for both before sorting and after sorting respectively.

At the end of the program, it will request user to input any number, then return the results to indicate if the targer existed.

# Update 21-Jun-17
